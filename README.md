[Hubl.in](https://hubl.in) is a free and open source video conference solution built with love and designed with ethics in mind.
It's the best way to initiate a communication anywhere with anybody and brings real time conversation to the next level.
Hubl.in allows free communication without additional plugins.

## Installation

1. clone the repository

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/linagora/hublin.git
```

2. Install and configure MongoDB

You must install mongoDB. We suggest you to use mongoDB version 2.6.5.

``` sh
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10
echo 'deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/debian-sysvinit dist 10gen' | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb.list
apt-get install -y mongodb-org=2.6.5 mongodb-org-server=2.6.5 mongodb-org-shell=2.6.5 mongodb-org-mongos=2.6.5 mongodb-org-tools=2.6.5
service mongod start
```

3. Install node.js

We are currently using Node 8. It is highly recommended that you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install a specific version of node.

``` sh
nvm use
# will install and use required node version
```

4. Install Redis

``` sh
apt-get install redis-server
```

5. Install the Janus Gateway

Check installation instructions on [Github](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway).

6. Copy the sample `db.json` configuration file and adapt it to your needs (especially the mongodb URL if you do not use default parameters from step 2)

``` sh
cp config/db.json.sample config/db.json
```

7. Install the required npm dependencies (as an administrator)

```
npm install -g mocha grunt-cli bower karma-cli
```

8. Go into the project root directory and install project dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Starting the server

Once all your services are ready, use `npm start` to start the server

``` sh
npm start
```

- Hublin is now available on `http://localhost:8080`.
- Janus admin / monitor is now available on `http://localhost/admin`.

## Testing

You can check that everything works by launching the test suite:

``` sh
grunt
```

If you want to launch tests from a single test, you can specify the file as command line argument.
For example, you can launch the backend tests on the `test/unit-backend/webserver/index.js` file like this:

``` sh
grunt test-unit-backend --test=test/unit-backend/webserver/index.js
```

Note: This works for backend and midway tests.

Some specialized Grunt tasks are also available, check the `Gruntfile.js` file for more:

```
grunt linters # launch hinter and linter against the codebase
grunt test-frontend # only run the fontend unit tests
grunt test-unit-backend # only run the unit backend tests
grunt test-midway-backend # only run the midway backend tests
grunt test # launch all the testsuite
```
## Fixtures

Fixtures can be configured in the fixtures folder and injected in the system using `grunt`:

``` sh
grunt fixtures
```

Note that this will override all the current configuration resources with the fixtures ones.

## Develop

Running `grunt dev` will start the server in development mode. Whenever you
make changes to server files, the server will be restarted. Make sure you have
started the `mongodb` and `redis` services beforehand.

### Updating files for distribution

`grunt` plugins are used to process files and generate distribution.
You will have to follow some rules to not break the distribution generation which are defined here.

#### Frontend

Any project frontend file which is under `frontend/js` and used in a web page must be placed between generator tags.
For example, in `frontend/views/meetings/index.pug` file:

``` html
// <!--build:js({.tmp,frontend}) meetings.js-->
script(src='/js/modules/user/user.js')
...
script(src='/js/meetings/app.js')
// <!--endbuild-->
```

The files placed between the two comment lines will be used to generate a `meetings.js` file (concatenate and minify all).

### Backend

All the files from backend are copied into the `dist/backend` folder without any change.

### Static files

These folders are pushed in the distribution:

- config
- templates

If you need to add more, you will have to change the `copy:dist` and `dist-files` tasks in `Gruntfile.js`

## Create a distribution

To create a distribution with clean environment, minified files and install production dependencies:

``` sh
grunt dist-all
cd dist
npm install --production
```

Then you can start the server with `npm start`, `node server`, or your favorite tool (Kudos to forever).

## Docker

Hubl.in is available on the Docker Hub as `linagora/hublin`, so you can pull it from there:

``` sh
docker pull linagora/hublin
```

Or you can build it from the current git repository

```
docker build -t linagora/hublin .
```

The `linagora/hublin` container is configured to get the mongodb connection from `mongodb://mongo:27017` URL. You can modify the `config/db.json` file and adapt to use your own instance, or continue to use Docker and use one of the solutions below.

### docker-compose

`docker-compose` allows to describe and run distributed applications (cf `docker-compose.yml` file).

#### Launch

``` sh
docker-compose up
```

#### Build

``` sh
docker-compose build
```
